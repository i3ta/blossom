# Blossom-dft

## Overview

This is a javascript-based discrete fourier transform package that turns an svg into a parametric function that can be graphed by a TI-Nspire calculator. Through this project, I hope to connect the intricacies of computer science and the beauty of art into one. 

The purpose of this project is mainly for the Taiwan 2022 TI Graphic Design Competition, in which I will be using this program to create pictures of *Prunus taiwaniana*, a blossom species endemic to Taiwan. 

Please link to this repository for any use of the programs in this package.
